# Starnet
**Welcome to `localhost`!**

Welcome to the Starnet GitHub organization. This is the root directory for all our Web and Mobile development logic.

## The Purpose
Consider this the main thread for everything we produce. Whether it is a scrappy internal tool, a major company project, or a client deliverable, this is where the code lives. We keep everything centrally located to avoid dependency hell.

## How We Flow
We keep our git process as clean as our code (hopefully):

- Clone the repo.
- Branch off for your feature.
- Open a PR when you are ready.

**Hotfixes**: These are the only things allowed to jump the queue directly to prod and main. Let’s try to keep these rare—we prefer our adrenaline rushes from caffeine, not from fixing production bugs on a Friday.

## Some Advice
- Rebase first: We are a team and we work fast. Please rebase your branch to main before pushing so we don't have to deal with merge conflicts.
- Don't be a stranger: Be polite in the comments. We are all humans here, not compilers.
- Context matters: If your PR title doesn't tell the whole story, write a description. Help us understand your logic so we can approve it faster.
- Issues: Found a bug? Feel free to submit an Issue. Just make sure it’s well-documented—an undocumented bug is just an undocumented feature.

## Need Admin Powers?
If you need a new repository created or need to rewrite history (pun intended), just ask your friendly neighborhood maintainer.
